**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I spent a lot of time working and fixing my project for OOP.  Aside from other homeworks & quizzes for my classes I realized I don’t really do anything special. Basically, my weeks revolve around school work and extracurricular activities, so sorry if my blogs are pretty boring. One interesting thing I did Saturday morning was attend an orientation to teach first graders every Saturday, I guess this was pretty interesting :)

During the orientation, we spent two hours going over the strategy to always win the game Nim, I’m pretty sure you’ve heard of it. We are going to be teaching first graders to strategically think of how to always win (think outside the box) for FIRST GRADERS! I wish I was exposed to something like this when I was in first grade, it’s pretty cool.

**What's in your way?**
Hmm… sometimes I honestly don’t even know myself what is in my way. I would say time… there’s not enough of it or time just always goes by quickly. I know youtube is one to blame since ‘one’ video leads to another and then another. I think another thing is that I tend to spend too much time on something and not be efficient with my time.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I will catch up on my readings and also set a specific time to work on the online class I’m taking, it’s so easy to fall behind and I don’t want that to happen. I will also work on a project for my other CS class, that’s just been assigned so I will get started early just incase I run into problems.

This week in OOP I experienced a lot of frustration in regards to the project and a lot of confusion in regards to the class material. I definitely need to play around with the material covered this past week, the R and L values, references, pointers, copies and not copies, all very confusing so I will definitely play around with that in C. I felt a lot of frustration with the project mainly just turning it in, I have never used the .gitignore file for github so that was a new experience.

**Tip of the week:**
So this past week I learned a shortcut to get things to appear the way you want it to on github using the .gitignore file. [Here] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/987142/make-gitignore-ignore-everything-except-a-few-files) is the reference to the shortcut I found, if you didn’t already know this, it will really help :) I know it helped me.
