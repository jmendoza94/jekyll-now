**What did you do this past week?**
This past week was a bit overwhelming since I had the first exam for OOP and also first exam for another class, a project, homework and meetings for extracurricular. I would have liked to spend more time studying for OOP, I thought the exam was pretty reasonable. There were 6 questions each worth between 30-65 points, all coding so no multiple choice. In the exam there were a few things that I would have liked to focus a bit more on.

**What's in your way?**
This week the thing that got in my way was as always, time, being more time efficient with it. I think another thing that gets in my way is commuting, I don’t live on or near campus so I realized I spend a lot of time going back and forward to campus.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I plan on working on the project for OOP and getting ahead on it. I also plan on working on a different project that’s due on Sunday and also plan on attending a career fair outside of UT next Saturday with a few friends. So I will try to make the most of my time this week.

**Tip of the week:**
Below is a link to the career fair/conference that will be this upcoming weekend. It is called the SASE National Conference and STEM Career Fair, it will be in Dallas, TX but it will be really interesting, they also have hackathon and it’s free!
