**What did you do this past week?**
This past week flew by so quickly. The biggest thing I did this week was work on my projects for OOP and my other CS class. It wasn’t too bad, I also attended a Career fair in Dallas, TX, it was pretty interesting. The career fair was located in a hotel and had a little over 81 companies.

**What's in your way?**
This week, traffic was in my way. There’s a lot of construction going on and sometimes that would delay me a bit. The biggest thing that got in my way was myself, since the semester is getting a lot more chaotic it’s been pretty stressful. Also, planning a huge event can be pretty stressful also but it’ll all be worth it in the end.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I will study for two exams I have in two weeks. I will catch up on things that have been slipping by. I will also work on homeworks and projects, the usual.

**Tip of the week:**
Here’s a cool website I came across (https://www.interviewcake.com)[ https://www.interviewcake.com]. The site basically gives you interview-type questions and gets your brain turning a bit. The site also gives you different situations to take into consideration before actually submitting your work to see if it’s correct or not.
