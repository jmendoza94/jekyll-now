**What did you do this past week?**
This past week was very busy for me. Let’s just say… I didn't get much sleep. I worked on the OOP project while also trying to study for an exam. But good thing I have figured out the best way for me to get a lot done and be very productive. I studied a lot with a close friend which was nice rather than studying alone.

**What's in your way?**
This past week my exam was in my way of being able to do my best for the OOP project and also lack of sleep. The lack of sleep really made me not want to give ALL of my effort, but I tried my best at that state of mind. 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I will implement what I’ve learned to be more productive and make the most of my time especially since I have the OOP exam along with other exams for other classes. My goal is just to take advantage of this week since it will not be so busy, aside from extracurricular activities. The best thing will be to not wait for the last minute to do things, not get lazy since I really want to rest but instead make the most of my time.

**Tip of the week:**
This past weekend I went home and learned that my five year old niece will be taking a STAR-like test in order to pass onto 1st grade. She can be very hyperactive but enjoys playing games. I found this cool website which has different levels for different ages so they can learn computer science fundamentals and get their brains working at a young age. So if any of you guys want to teaching CS things to a family member/ kid/ teen this is a very cool site: https://studio.code.org
