What did you do this past week?
This week I studied for the quiz we were given on Friday and also began reading the object oriented programming textbook.

What's in your way?
The things that have gotten in my way this week has been meetings and getting settled into the semester.

What will you do next week?
Next week I will go over the new posts on our class websites.

So far I think this class will be challenging, but rewarding. Glenn Downing really desires to prepare his students for their careers once they graduate which is something that means a lot to me as a senior graduating in May 2017. The class is a bit nerve racking since he does call on people to answer questions about the piece of code on the screen but in the end we are all here to learn, so it doesn't matter if you answer completely wrong, as long as you try and learn.
