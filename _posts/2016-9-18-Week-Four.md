**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I worked on my OOP project while also working on a project for Modern Web Apps. This upcoming week is very busy for me, I have a project due on Sunday, and an exam and project due on Thursday so I tried to do as much as I could to relieve the workload.

**What's in your way?**
Things that were in my way this past week were chores that had to be done and I also feel like I spent a lot of time on reading and planning things for the OOP project and now I need to actually implement my plan. It’s a bit frustrating because not knowing everything that’s in the makefile takes up more time to actually implement the project because I need to look up what everything in the makefile is actually doing in order to run my project.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I need to study for my exam I have on Thursday and also work on the OOP project. I need to organize myself so that can finish my project on time and also do good on my exam, this is going to be tough since they both require a lot of time. I also plan on attending the Natural Science career fair on Tuesday, even if it’s just for a little bit.

**Tip of the week:**
Something interesting is that there’s a new method of creating “random numbers with less computational effort than other methods.” This new method creates “higher levels of security.”  [Here]( https://login.cs.utexas.edu/news/2016/new-method-producing-random-numbers-could-improve-cybersecurity) is the link for the source and more information about the research and Professor involved.
