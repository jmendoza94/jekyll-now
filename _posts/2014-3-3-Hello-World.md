So far I think this class will be challenging, but rewarding. Glenn Downing really desires to prepare his students for their careers once they graduate which is something that means a lot to me as a senior graduating in May 2017. The class is a bit nerve racking since he does call on people to answer questions about the piece of code on the screen but in the end we are all here to learn, so it doesn't matter if you answer completely wrong, as long as you try and learn.
