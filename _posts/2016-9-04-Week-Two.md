**What did you do this past week?**
This past week was very chaotic for me. So far two of my classes are kind of slow, the material hasn’t picked up as much but I do have a lot of homework for each of my classes. So, this week I’ve been trying to keep up with everything and work on my homework, go over my notes in preparation for the OOP quizzes but thankfully we didn’t have a quiz on Friday.  On top of that, I’ve been preparing myself and my computer for the OOP project due on Thursday.

**What's in your way?**
There’s two major things that have gotten in my way this past week which were the organization I’m involved with since Party on the Plaza requires some time. I’m also trying to figure out a way to balance my schedule with school, extra curricular activities and sleep. 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I will make an hourly schedule in order to have balance within my day and to accomplish the many things I need to do. I will also continue working on the OOP project, my homework, and quizzes for my classes.

This past week I found it very interesting that Professor Downing took the time to spend two whole lectures to go over the project that’s due this Thursday. From my experience of being at UT I have never had a professor go over a project with such detail. I find that very nice since the first project may be a bit confusing since it’s a new class, so it was extremely helpful. 

**Tip of the week:**
A while back I ran into a flyer in the GDC about an organization/mentorship program called Code Orange that teaches 7-12 year old kids to program. Recently, this program popped into my day again and sounds very interesting. As my brother always says “what’s the purpose of being knowledgeable about something if you can’t teach it.” If anyone is interested in mentoring kids and sharing some programming knowledge click [here]( https://login.cs.utexas.edu/news/2016/code-orange-teaches-children-how-code-use-technology) for some more insight on this program.
