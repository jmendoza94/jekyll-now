I'm currently a senior at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in Computer Science and also working on my Business Foundation Certificate. I'm from Houston, Texas but I enjoy getting involved on campus and with the Austin Community.

### More Information

I've been a sister of Kappa Delta Chi Sorority, Inc. since Spring 2013 and am also heavily involved with The Project, a service organization at UT.
